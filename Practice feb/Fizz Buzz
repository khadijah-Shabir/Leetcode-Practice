/*
public List<String> fizzBuzz(int n) {

public: This keyword indicates that the method is accessible from outside the class. 
It means that other classes can use and call this method.
List<String>: This specifies the return type of the method. It indicates that the method will return a list of strings.
fizzBuzz: This is the name of the method. Methods in Java are identified by their names, 
and this is the name you will use to call this method from other parts of the program.
(int n): These are the parameters that the method takes. In this case, it takes a single parameter of type int named n.
 This parameter represents the limit up to which we want to generate the "FizzBuzz" sequence.

List<String> ans = new ArrayList<>();

List<String> ans: This declares a variable named ans of type List<String>. 
This variable will hold the list of strings that will be generated during the "FizzBuzz" computation.
new ArrayList<>();: This creates a new instance of the ArrayList class.
 ArrayList is a type of list in Java that dynamically resizes itself as elements are added or removed. 
The angle brackets <> indicate that this ArrayList will hold elements of type String. 
This newly created empty list is then assigned to the variable ans.

/*
Now let's dry run this code with n = 15:

i = 1: Not divisible by 3 or 5, add "1" to the list.
i = 2: Not divisible by 3 or 5, add "2" to the list.
i = 3: Divisible by 3, add "Fizz" to the list.
i = 4: Not divisible by 3 or 5, add "4" to the list.
i = 5: Divisible by 5, add "Buzz" to the list.
i = 6: Divisible by 3, add "Fizz" to the list.
i = 7: Not divisible by 3 or 5, add "7" to the list.
i = 8: Not divisible by 3 or 5, add "8" to the list.
i = 9: Divisible by 3, add "Fizz" to the list.
i = 10: Divisible by 5, add "Buzz" to the list.
i = 11: Not divisible by 3 or 5, add "11" to the list.
i = 12: Divisible by 3, add "Fizz" to the list.
i = 13: Not divisible by 3 or 5, add "13" to the list.
i = 14: Not divisible by 3 or 5, add "14" to the list.
i = 15: Divisible by both 3 and 5, add "FizzBuzz" to the list.
The resulting list would be ["1", "2", "Fizz", "4", "Buzz", "Fizz", "7", "8", "Fizz", "Buzz", "11", "Fizz", "13", "14", "FizzBuzz"].
